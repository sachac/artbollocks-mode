artbollocks-mode.el
===================

artbollocks-mode.el is an emacs minor mode for avoiding cliche and bad grammar
when writing about art.

Installation
============

Place artbollocks-mode.el in a directory on Emacs' load-path, and add the
following to your .emacs file:

(autoload 'artbollocks-mode "artbollocks-mode")

If you wish artbollocks-mode to be loaded automatically, add the following
to your .emacs file immediately after the autoload statement:

(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'artbollocks-mode)

Manual Usage
============

If you do not add the add-hook statements to your .emacs file, you will have to
enable artbollocks-mode manually  by typing the following in Emacs:

M-x artbollocks-mode

NOTE: If you manually enable artbollocks-mode, you you might need to force
re-fontification initially. To do so, type the following in Eamcs:

M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer

Art Bollocks Mode highlights those pesky weasel words that slip into
writing.

To add this to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el or ~/.emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/wherever/you/extracted/artbollocks-mode")
(require 'artbollocks-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'artbollocks-mode)
